This was the first game I ever made with Unity in the summer of 2019, after I had completed my GCSEs. I used a YouTube tutorial by Games Plus James <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiyfvmtjWC_Up8XNvM3OSqgbJoMQgHkVz">(link)</a>, a beginner tutorial for creating one's first game. This was a 2D platformer game that had small combat elements also. It was a good tutorial to follow as it introduced me to many beginner concepts I was previously unaware of, such as how to control the player through scripting and creating behaviour for the enemies to attack and react to the player. I started by creating a simple level with a few blocks that the player can run across to the exit. I then added an enemy that the player would have to fight and beat, using their melee and ranged weapons.

Once the base mechanics of the game were working, I used a tiling tool within Unity that allows the user to quickly create 2D levels using a terrain spritesheet of their design. This tool allowed me to quickly a design a set of levels of varying difficulty and order them into a small group of levels that would be the game, with the completion of each level leading to the start of the next. I then created a boss for the player to fight against at the end of the game. This was not part of the tutorial I was following so I thought of an idea for a boss that would be easy for a beginner to implement but still provide a fun challenge for the player. I made an enemy that split into two, smaller, faster enemies with less health when killed, and did so a few times. When the player killed all of the sub-enemies, the door would open, and they could complete the level.

Although the tutorial came with sample sprites to use for the characters and the terrain, I decided to use what I had already taught myself in Adobe Photoshop to create my own pixel art to give the game a more unique feel, even though I was following a step-by-step tutorial. This approach, as well as allowing me to make the game feel more individual, also helped me develop my photoshop and art skills and reminded me of my love for pixel art in games. I would go on to embrace this art style in many games I make. To run the game, go into the 'builds' folder. From here, you will find several builds of the game, the most recent of which will be the best. Download the folder and run the .exe file to play the game.

Upon opening this project again years after its creation I realise many errors I made, but I have been reluctant to return to the game to improve it as I think it is more important to move on and create more games to expand a diverse skillset. As well as this, I also think this game remaining in its current form is a useful demonstration of the exact level of skill I had when completing my first project, and how far I have come since then. However, if I were to make this game again or aim to improve it I would spend more time testing, which would have given me the knowledge to know how to fix certain problems such as the bossâ€™ inconsistent damage.
