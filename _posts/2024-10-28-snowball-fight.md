I found a second YouTube tutorial from the same creator that was intended to be a direct continuation from the first, developing skills learned and introducing new intermediate concepts. The game’s mechanics are very similar to the first, adopting the same 2D platformer elements, but with a different objective. While controls and mechanics remained largely unchanged, the goal of the game evolved from “reach the end of the level” to “beat your opponent”. This allowed me to rely on skills I already possessed and was confident I could replicate with ease, and instead focus on implementing new features and learning new skills. I learned how to have two players controlled simultaneously as well as facilitate two player health bars as a scoring system.

This was a short tutorial series for a relatively simple game, so I decided to test my design skills further by creating a re-skin for the game. The tutorial offered some basic Christmas-themed spritesheets to be used in the game so, after I had finished the tutorial using these, I designed my own Halloween spritesheet. The way I implemented this reskin was by having the player choose from two levels when they open the game. The problem with this method is that any further changes I wanted to make to the base game had to be applied to both levels. I could fix this by finding a way for the objects in a single level to choose which spritesheet it takes its textures from. I could then design different level layouts too and choose either texture to use on any of them, rather than have two level layouts and a set texture for each.

Another improvement I would make to the game is to add more elements of gameplay to make it more interesting, such as powerups or different weapons. Maybe the players could also choose different characters to play as that have either different appearance, different stats, or both.
