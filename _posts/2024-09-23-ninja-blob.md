This was the first game I ever made with Unity in the summer of 2019, after I had completed my GCSEs. I used a YouTube tutorial by Games Plus James (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiyfvmtjWC_Up8XNvM3OSqgbJoMQgHkVz), a beginner tutorial for creating a first game. This was a 2D platformer game that had small combat elements also.

It was a good tutorial to follow as it introduced me to many beginner concepts I was previously unaware of, such as how to control the player through scripting and creating behaviour for the enemies to attack and react to the player.

Although the tutorial came with sample sprites to use for the characters and the terrain, I decided to use what I had already taught myself in Adobe Photoshop to create my own pixel art to give the game a more unique feel, even though I was following a step-by-step tutorial.

To run the game, go into the 'builds' folder. From here, you will find several builds of the game, the most recent of which will be the best. Download the folder and run the .exe file to play the game.
